[WIP] Visual novel game engine with a focus on customization.

This is a major WIP, but my goal is essentially to bring RenPy with extreme customization, portability, and speed to the browser.
The example game will likely be a release of a DDLC fan game.

Until the word WIP is purged from this README, assume that this is completely unusable.
