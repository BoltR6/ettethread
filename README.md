[WIP] Visual novel game engine with a focus on customization, portability, and preformance.

The showcase for this game will likely be a release of a Doki Doki Literature Club fan title.

## Primary Goals
- Bring the power of GPT3.5-turbo to games.
Why hasn't this been done? I don't know, honestly. However, I think games like visual novels are perfectly suited for this.
These games have been missing AI dialog, and I believe that it will allow players to further explore a universe tailed to their gameplay.
- Speed.
RenPy is not browsers friendly. This is. And this is FAST. p5.js has proven its worth for optimization thus far.
- Self-hostability.
I like the ability to host my own game, and I think you should too. This allows you to host the entire game via NodeJS.

## Features:
- Characters
- Uniforms
- Emotions
- Variable system
- Custom langauge
- Easy to learn bash-like syntax
- Scenes
- Easy pathing
- Artificially generatable dialog
- AI 'goal' system
- AI filtering system


Until the word WIP is purged from this README, this is NOT a release. This will be a long-running project.
